"""
This module defines a command pattern implementation for handling webhook actions. 
It includes a `command` class designed to encapsulate all the information needed to 
perform an action, including the server configuration, headers, and payload. 

The `command` class requires a logger instance upon initialization to facilitate logging 
throughout the execution process. The core functionality of the command is implemented 
in the `execute` method, which is intended to be overridden with specific logic for 
handling various webhook events.

Usage:
    - Instantiate the `command` class with the necessary parameters (logger, server_config, header, payload).
    - Call the `execute` method to perform the action defined within.
